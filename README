LuaChaSen

Requirements:
 - Lua 5.1 (http://www.lua.org/)
 - UTF-8 enabled ChaSen (http://chasen-legacy.sourceforge.jp/)

Enabling UTF-8 on ChaSen:
 * Make sure that you have the .cha and .dic files in the same directory. It's
 located at /usr/lib/chasen/dic/ipadic/ on my system.
 * Convert the *.cha and *.dic files into UTF-8. You can do this with
 nkf/iconv/convmv, whatever you have at hand really. The original files are
 encoded in EUC-JP.
 * Convert your chasenrc into UTF-8. It's located at /etc/chasenrc on my
 system.

Note that you will to tell chasen to use UTF-8 with -i w.

Use:
 bool = chasen.init(<fmt string>): See chasen -Fh for more information.
 str = chasen.sparse(<string>)

TODO:
 - We should expose the rest of the API:
    * chasen_fparse_tostr
    * chasen_fparse
    * chasen_sparse
 - .init should really accept a table also.
